# My Personal Project

### -A **bulleted** list-
- What will the application do?

    This application will gather information about your current bank account
    status such as savings, debt, equity, and loans, and it will
    display it. It will focus more towards equity or the application may only
    contain equity. *Equity manager/management* is the aim for this
    application. It is basically an investment manager that keeps a track
    of your investments in stocks and displays your portfolio.

- Who will use it?

    Anyone who is willing to or has already invested in stocks will benefit
    from using this application as it'll display an organized
    visual representation of your equities, such as what stocks you
    currently own, how many, how much, and much more.

- Why is this project of interest to you?

    At first, I was planning to do something like a debt manager, as I've
    seen some ads about it while watching youtube. But, then I realized
    that I am a young investor who owns a bit of some stocks in the market
    and it would be helpful to make such an application for myself
    and other investors out there. Both debt and quity manager was what
    came to my mind first, when I started thinking about
    what to create. *I am not 100% certain about doing equity though,
    I may want to do both equity and debt or just equity or debt.
    I'll find out before 2nd phase of the project hopefully.*

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
